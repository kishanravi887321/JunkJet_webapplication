JunkJet - Optimized Waste Management System

Overview

JunkJet is an AI-powered waste management platform that optimizes the process of connecting waste sellers with buyers and recyclers. The project utilizes a hexagonal grid-based search algorithm for efficient spatial matching, ensuring precise and scalable location-based searches.

Key Features

Hexagonal Grid Search: Enhances spatial accuracy by maintaining equal distances between neighboring cells, reducing blind spots.

AI-Powered Chatbot: Enables sellers to find the nearest buyer dynamically through natural language interaction.

Three-Phase System: Supports different user categories:

Phase 1: Individual sellers

Phase 2: Middle buyers/organizations

Phase 3: Large-scale recyclers

Dynamic Search Expansion: Searches begin within a specific hexagonal cell and expand outward when necessary, ensuring optimal efficiency.

Why Hexagonal Grid?

More Accurate Searches: Unlike square grids, hexagonal grids eliminate diagonal distortions and provide more accurate distance calculations.

Optimized Computational Efficiency: Searching neighbors in a hexagonal structure is faster and requires fewer computations.

Scalability: Dynamically expands based on user demand while maintaining structured spatial organization.

Backend Architecture

Tech Stack: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB

Authentication: JWT-based authentication system

Search Algorithm: Custom-built hexagonal grid-based location matching system

API Endpoints:
